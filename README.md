Scripts for parsing data of ISCA24

- cleaning_data.py: Takes the dump provided by Whova and creates a spreadsheet with two sheets. One for all the students and another for seniors. The .xlsx file has to be placed in this folder.

- extract_data.py: Takes the output of the former script and extracts information about workshops, mentors, mentees, etc.
